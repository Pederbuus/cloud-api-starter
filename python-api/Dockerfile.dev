# --- Development Dockerfile for FastAPI/SQLModel Project ---

# Use the official Python 3.13 slim image as the base.
# Note: Python 3.13 is a future version/in pre-release; adjust the tag 
# (e.g., to python:3.12-slim) if 3.13.7 is not yet stable/available on Docker Hub.
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
ENV APP_PORT 8000
ENV HOST 0.0.0.0

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install dependencies
# We use a two-step process to leverage Docker's build cache:
# 1. Copy only the requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# 2. Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port where Uvicorn will run
EXPOSE ${APP_PORT}

# Default command to run the application in development mode with auto-reloading.
# Assumes your main FastAPI application object is named 'app' in 'main.py'.
# The reload flag watches for file changes and restarts the server automatically.
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]

# To use this, you would typically build and run with:
# docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t my-app-dev .
# docker run -p 8000:8000 my-app-dev
