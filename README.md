# Multi-Language API Project

## 🎯 Goal
Learn to write in **Rust**, **Java**, and **Python** (maybe **C++**).  

### Objectives
1. **API Service (per language)**
   - Implement an API that supports `POST / GET / DELETE` requests on a database (DB choice to be determined).
   - Comment the code and the overall structure of the program
   - Create README for each language (research standard custom)

2. **Testing**
   - Implement tests for each language.
   - Measure **throughput** and performance.

3. **Cloud Setup**
   - Configure deployment on **Azure**.
   - _Research goals_

## 📌 Requirements

### API Endpoints
- `GET /notes` → list all notes  
- `POST /notes` → create a note  
- `GET /notes/{id}` → retrieve a single note  
- `DELETE /notes/{id}` → delete a note  

### Utility Endpoints
- `GET /time` → returns the current time  
- `GET /total` → returns the total number of notes in the DB  

### Security
- Implement **credentials-based access** (authentication/authorization). _Research needed_

## ⏳ Timeline
- **21-08-2025** → Setup Rust (prior **Rust** knowledge: ~1%)

## TODO
- Get started
